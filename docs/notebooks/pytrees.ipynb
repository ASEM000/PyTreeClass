    "Using pytrees as function inputs is beneficial when working with complex models or data structures that have a hierarchical organization. It allows you to write functions that operate on the structure and elements of the input pytrees in a generic and modular way. This flexibility simplifies the code and enhances reusability, as the same function can be used with different pytrees that follow the same structure."
